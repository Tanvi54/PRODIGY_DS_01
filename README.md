# 🧠 Heart Disease Data Visualization – Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 1

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the **Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship**, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle.

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized health-related features used to predict the presence of heart disease.  
**Key Columns**:
- `age`: Patient age (continuous)
- `gender`: 0 = Female, 1 = Male (categorical)
- `cholesterol`, `rest_bp`, `max_hr`: Continuous medical features
- `diagnosis`: 0 = No disease, 1 = Disease (target)
- Other features: `chest_pain`, `st_depression`, `thalassemia`, etc.

## 📊 Visualizations

### ✅ Visuals Created:
- Age distribution (Histogram)
- Gender distribution (Bar plot)
- Age Distribution by Diagnosis (Histogram)
- Heart disease count (Countplot)
- Cholesterol vs. diagnosis (Barplot)
- Resting Blood Pressure (Histogram)
